 Bug 1180878 - [e10s] Can't Print to PDF if folder name contains spaces
</a>
<div>
 Yes! I can reproduce this! It looks like we're sending the job to the printer that is selected in the dialog even though we said we wanted to save it as a PDF.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So something has gone awry.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Note that this works if there is no space in the name, as Felipe correctly pointed out. So I wonder if somehow we're screwing up serializing the directory name that we're supposed to be saving to?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Relevant field in NSPrintInfo:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 <div>
  <b>
   NSPrintJobSavingURL
  </b>
 </div>
 <div>
  <br/>
 </div>
</div>
<div>
 "An NSURL containing the location to which the job file will be saved when the
 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSPrintInfo_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSPrintInfo/jobDisposition">
  jobDisposition
 </a>
 is
 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSPrintInfo_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/data/NSPrintSaveJob">
  NSPrintSaveJob
 </a>
 ."
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I stored this in toFileName in the PrintData struct.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 HYPOTHESIS TIME:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 We're not correctly serializing the toFileName from the parent when the parent has sent a filename with a space in it.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Test: Attach a debugger and see what the parent is sending up through toFileName when we have a space in the folder, and see what the NSURL is that the child constructs when deserializing the PrintData to the NSPrintInfo dictionary.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Our hypothesis was almost correct. The real problem is that we're not DESERIALIZING correctly.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The NSURL that goes in is:
</div>
<div>
 jobSavingURL    NSURL *    @"file://localhost/Users/mikeconley/Projects/Felipe%20Test/Nightly%20Start%20Page.pdf"
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The NSURL that gets constructed in the child is:
</div>
<div>
 jobSavingURL    NSURL *    @"file://localhost/Users/mikeconley/Projects/Felipe%2520Test/Nightly%2520Start%2520Page.pdf"
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So it's an escaping problem!
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The solution is to assume that when we're deserializing an NSURL, that it is already percent encoded and doesn't need to be re-encoded again.
