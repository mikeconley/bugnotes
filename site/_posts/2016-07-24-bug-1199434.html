 Bug 1199434 - [e10s] Print preview doesn't show alert if printer was't found.
</a>
<div>
 So the way things currently are, if the print engine detects an error in any number of places, it'll call nsPrintEngine::ShowPrintErrorDialog passing in an nsresult, which gets converted into a string and then a dialog is opened showing that string.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 In the content process, we can't open dialogs.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 This printing stuff still needs to work in the other XUL apps though, like Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, where they don't need to worry about multiple processes.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So what do we do about these error dialogs?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Assuming we want to keep them, they'll need to be opened in the parent process.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Is it possible to make it so that printUtils is responsible for showing the error dialogs?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 One idea is to have nsPrintEngine send a message to the global message manager, and then the parent (or the in-process parent) picks it up in printUtils.js to display the error.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I think I'll go that route if I can.
</div>
<div>

 Ok, I have a patch up, and it seems to work… I'd like to test it with each error message type, if I can… also, I should do a try build to make sure it actually solves the problem originally reported.

 Alrighty - patch written. Pretty happy with it. I think it makes a lot more sense to have PrintUtils be responsible for alerting about errors in printing, etc.
