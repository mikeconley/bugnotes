 Maybe just need to put PostPresent in the right place in ClientLayerManager...

 BAH, so this isn’t exactly right. We’re measuring the wrong thing - this old way of measuring is getting the amount of time it takes for the parent to update the internal state, and then to paint things, but NOT to upload the painted textures nor to composite them.

 What we really want to do is measure from the point where the tab selection starts, to the point where we get the next MozAfterPaint. That captures tab selection, painting, and compositing.
