 Bug 1134252 - [e10s] PBrowserChild::SendGetRenderFrameInfo fails with 'message was deserialized, but contained an illegal value'
</a>
<div>
 Okie dokie, here we go.
</div>

<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So something is going wrong in the messaging between PBrowserChild and PBrowserParent, involving the SendGetRenderFrameInfo message.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 '(msgtype=0x200002,name=PBrowser::Msg_PRenderFrameConstructor) Value error: message was deserialized, but contained an illegal value'
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Actually, it seems like it's the Msg_PRenderFrameConstructor message.  Huh.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The child sends this message, and the parent flips out and kills the child.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ok, in TabChild::ProvideWindowCommon, we've got this:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 <code>
  PRenderFrameChild*
  <a>
   renderFrame
  </a>
  =
  <a>
   newChild
  </a>
  <a>
   -&gt;
  </a>
  SendPRenderFrameConstructor();
 </code>
 <br/>
 <code>
  <a>
   newChild
  </a>
  <a>
   -&gt;
  </a>
  SendGetRenderFrameInfo(
  <a>
   renderFrame
  </a>
  ,
 </code>
 <br/>
 <code>
  &amp;
  <a>
   textureFactoryIdentifier
  </a>
  ,
 </code>
</div>
<div>
 <code>
  &amp;
  <a>
   layersId
  </a>
  );
 </code>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 That SendPRenderFrameConstructor bit is, I think async, but that next line is sync.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 That first bit fails, and so we kill the child, which is stuck waiting for results on the second.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So something is going wrong in that construction there.
</div>

<div>
 TabParent::AllocPRenderFrameParent is returning nullptr, which causes the child abort.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Test: Alter ContentParent::AllocPScreenManagerParent so that it returns a nullptr, to see if we get a similar message.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Result: WE DO. I think it's highly likely that this is the problem here...
</div>

<div>
 There is a window of time between TabParent::RecvCreateWindow and TabParent::AllocPRenderFrameParent where either:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<ol>
 <li>
  The window has already been destroyed by the time we received TabParent::AllocPRenderFrameParent
 </li>
 <li>
  The frame element can't seem to get resolved to a frame loader.
 </li>
</ol>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I think (1) is probably our best bet - suppose we're opening a new popup window… and the parent runs TabParent::RecvCreateWindow, and the window starts to be constructed, and that's all good, and then we send the result back down to the child, which starts to respond immediately and sends a sync message up to the parent… but maybe within that time, the user closed the window? Is that possible?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Let's see if we can trigger it! I'll open windows in the content process, and then close them in the parent as soon as they open.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Hrm. No luck reproducing just yet. :/
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So, I think I need to think about the lifetime of RenderFrameParent, and what occurs if allocating the RFP in the parent fails.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Here's what I'm thinking...
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Instead of returning nullptr in AllocPRenderFrameParent, always return the RenderFrameParent, even if success was false… but if success was false, then in the child, we'll realize that we can't get a layer ID, and then we'll delete the RenderFrameParent/Child pair. And then… well, we're in kind of a weird state then.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 And how do I test this is working correctly? Well… I can make it so that we always fail to create a RenderFrameParent correctly. This will probably be interesting.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Let's see what happens!
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 billm likes it, and he's assuaged my fears - if the mFrameLoader doesn't exist, we are screwwwwwed - and the cases where this probably happens is when the tab has gone away. The frameloader can't not exist when still being set-up - it's only in teardown when this can occur.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So this is probably occurring when a tab is opened and closed extremely quickly.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So let's land this puppy!
