<div>Good STR, I can reproduce. So what’s going wrong here?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Huh… and when I set a breakpoint in pageinfo.js’s makePreview, the bug goes away. Smells like a race!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ahhh… the image is being set properly, but in the cases where the image doesn’t show, it looks like the width and the height aren’t being set properly. Interesting...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also, this seems to only apply to images of type Background. Interesting...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ah, heh, yep - <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1180991#c8">jimicy already noticed this</a>. Should have read the bug all the way through.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Okay, I think I’ve solved this one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The thing is that in single-process, the image sources have been loaded in the same process, so the cache is able to set things like the naturalHeight and naturalWidth on the preview image immediately.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In multi-process, images are loaded in a separate process, which means that we have to hit some async part of the cache. naturalWidth and naturalHeight are 0 on the preview image, and we just roll with that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So part of the solution is to get the naturalWidth and naturalHeight from the child.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One wrinkle though, is the favicon. Favicons aren’t actually loaded by the content process - they’re loaded by the parent process. So in that case, we want to go with the old technique.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>#aux-nav .other-apps a {</div>
<div>    padding-left:24px;</div>
<div>    background-repeat:no-repeat;</div>
<div>    background-position:left 4px;</div>
<div>    background-image:url(../../img/app-icons/16/sprite.png?33db7a2)</div>
<div>}</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Okay… there’s still a problem here. The problem is that background images that are not displayed (example, in a display:none block) are not shown. Interesting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The problem is that for those images, they’re not yet loaded - they load <b>after</b> the fact. Okay, I guess one could make the media node pumping more async.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Conclusion: I think we should RESOLVE this bug and file a new bug for this special-case. I think the new bug should not block e10s, even if it’s a regression.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To be honest, I think a lot of the PageInfo mechanism can be rewritten.</div>
<div><br/></div>
