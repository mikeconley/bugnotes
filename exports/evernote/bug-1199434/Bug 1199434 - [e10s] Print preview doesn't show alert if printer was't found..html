<div>So the way things currently are, if the print engine detects an error in any number of places, it'll call nsPrintEngine::ShowPrintErrorDialog passing in an nsresult, which gets converted into a string and then a dialog is opened showing that string.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In the content process, we can't open dialogs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This printing stuff still needs to work in the other XUL apps though, like Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, where they don't need to worry about multiple processes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So what do we do about these error dialogs?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Assuming we want to keep them, they'll need to be opened in the parent process.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Is it possible to make it so that printUtils is responsible for showing the error dialogs?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One idea is to have nsPrintEngine send a message to the global message manager, and then the parent (or the in-process parent) picks it up in printUtils.js to display the error.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think I'll go that route if I can.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ok, I have a patch up, and it seems to work… I'd like to test it with each error message type, if I can… also, I should do a try build to make sure it actually solves the problem originally reported.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Alrighty - patch written. Pretty happy with it. I think it makes a lot more sense to have PrintUtils be responsible for alerting about errors in printing, etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
